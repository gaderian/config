# My vim config and plugins
For the config to be kept up to date there should be a link placed in ~/ 
pointing to the .vimrc file of this repo. This can be achieved by running 
`startup.sh` from the root of this repo.

There is also a need for exuberant-ctags to be installed in order for taglist to
work.
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install exuberant-ctags
```
